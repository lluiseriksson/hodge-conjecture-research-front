# Formalization boundary

Status: **EXPLORATORY**.

The first realistic formal target is B001's projective-space degree bookkeeping
and the compatibility equations for pullback/pushforward of cycle classes.
Formalizing the full conjecture would require substantial algebraic-geometry
and Hodge-theory infrastructure not presently claimed here.

B007 adds a second stable boundary. Its denominator-clearing lemma and the
logical composition

\[
\text{universal local nonvanishing}\Longrightarrow
\text{middle perpendicularity}\Longrightarrow\text{HC}
\]

are realistic abstract interfaces. The decisive inputs - mixed Hodge modules,
local intersection cohomology, resolution with top-weight strictness, and the
BFNP singularity calculation - are not present in the current formal
toolchain. They must be imported only as explicitly named external theorems,
never replaced by a project-local axiom that silently asserts G005.

Rules:

- no `sorry`, admitted theorem, or project-local axiom may carry open
  algebraicity content on a stable branch;
- conditional interfaces must expose every hypothesis in their type;
- a kernel-checked implication from an explicit hypothesis package is labeled
  `CONDITIONAL`, not `FORMALLY VERIFIED` as a solution of that hypothesis;
- toolchain version and theorem inventory must accompany any future code.
